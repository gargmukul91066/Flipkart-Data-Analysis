## 🧾 Project Summary

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing customer support feedback data from Flipkart to uncover patterns and insights related to customer satisfaction (CSAT). The objective was to perform end-to-end data processing and visual analytics to help understand key drivers behind customer sentiment and satisfaction.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

In a competitive e-commerce landscape, understanding customer satisfaction is crucial. Flipkart receives a large volume of support feedback that is difficult to analyze manually. This project transforms that raw feedback into structured insights to help monitor, evaluate, and improve customer experience.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

- **Size**: 85,907 rows × 20 columns  
- **Key Features**:  
  - `Customer Remarks`, `Category`, `Sub-category`, `Item_price`, `Agent_name`, `CSAT Score`, etc.
- **Missing Data**:  
  - `connected_handling_time`: ~99% missing  
  - `order_date_time`, `Customer_City`, `Product_category`: 70–80% missing

## 🛠️ Key Steps & Techniques

### 🔧 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and inconsistent entries.
- Converted `object` types to `datetime` for date fields.
- Dropped irrelevant columns (`Unique_id`).

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Uncovered trends, correlations, and distributions using:
  - **Bar Charts**
  - **Heatmaps**
  - **Count Plots**
- Identified outliers in `Item_price` using **IQR Method**, then applied **clipping** to manage them.

### 🧪 Statistical Testing
- Applied IQR-based outlier detection.
- Considered correlation analysis to validate data relationships.

### ⚖️ Handling Class Imbalance
- Used **RandomOverSampler** to balance CSAT score distribution.

### 🔐 Encoding Techniques
- **One-Hot Encoding**: For low-cardinality categorical features.  
- **Binary Encoding**: For high-cardinality columns (e.g., `Agent_name`, `Manager`).

### 📈 Scaling
- Applied **StandardScaler** to normalize numerical features (mean = 0, std = 1).

---

## ✨ Key Insights
- Agent shift, tenure, and product category showed significant correlation with CSAT.
- Imbalanced class distribution was handled effectively for reliable modeling.
- Visualizations provided strong clarity on customer sentiment patterns.

---

## ❓ Q&A

**Q: What was the main challenge?**  
A: High missing value ratios and imbalanced satisfaction scores.

**Q: Why binary encoding for some features?**  
A: To handle high-cardinality columns efficiently without expanding feature space.

**Q: Why IQR over Z-score?**  
A: IQR is less sensitive to extreme values and more robust for skewed data.

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analytics can unlock key insights from customer support feedback using structured cleaning, visualization, and analysis. The pipeline is scalable for further ML-based satisfaction prediction or dashboard integration.

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Integrate real-time dashboard with Streamlit or Power BI.
- Deep dive into sentiment analysis using NLP.
- Deploy automated alert system for low CSAT detection.
